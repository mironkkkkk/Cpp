One day, a birch tree was brought to us as a gift, dug up by the roots. We put her in a box with earth and put her in a room by the window. Soon the branches of the birch tree rose, and she became cheerful.
Autumn settled in the garden. The maples burned purple, the bushes turned pink, and in some places yellow strands appeared on the birches. But we did not notice any signs of wilting near our tree.
The first frost came at night. I woke up early, got dressed and went out into the garden. Dawn was breaking, the blue in the east was replaced by a crimson haze. The birches turned yellow to the tops overnight, and the leaves fell off them in a private sad rain.
In the room, in the pale light of dawn, I saw that our birch tree had turned lemon. The warmth of the room did not save her.
A day later, she flew all over the place, as if she did not want to lag behind her friends.
The last memory of summer is gone.
